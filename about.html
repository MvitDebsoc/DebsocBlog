  Debsoc, the official Debate Society of Sir MVIT was started 8 years ago for expressive minds to come together and
  engage in healthy debates.
</p>
<p class="my-3">
  The society works hard to achieve the most in all areas of Speech & Debate and acts as a platform for students to
  voice their thoughts, shape opinions and engage in healthy conversation while helping those who want to express
  themselves more, do so.
